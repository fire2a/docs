Welcome to Fire2a's research group user documentation, choose your component:

[__QGIS Fire Analytics Toolbox__](qgis-toolbox): Our research as **user friendly graphical tools**: Simulate wildfires, get risk metrics, optimize firebreak location, etc. All from within [QGIS]. **Simple as filling a form**. Also available: drag'n'drop boxes (algorithms) into a *GIS-data-science-pipeline*.

[__Cell2FireW__](Cell2FireW): Forest fire simulator ([Forked]) and improved ([Here]). Supports Canada, Kitral, S&B fuel models , surface and crown fire, deals with weather scenarios, surface and vegetation moisture content; various output metrics. Also enhances in memory management, platform support, etc. **C++ only command line interface.**

[__Algorithms Library__](algo-lib) of common tasks & patterns of GIS. Also showcasing proof of concepts and special algorithms developed such as landscape clustering, firebreak optimization allocation, downstream protection value, etc. **A python package.**

[__QGIS cookbook__](qgis-cookbook): Install & setup guides, python environments, plugins and workflows examples.

[__QGIS management__](qgis-management): Install & setup guides, python environments, plugins and workflows examples.

[__Getting help__](getting-help): How to reach us, before getting help checklist, help message indispensables.
