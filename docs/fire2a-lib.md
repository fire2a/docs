# Algorithms Library

This library is a [Python package] containing fire-related algorithms, decision optimization tools, common utilities, and tools for GIS, clustering, and more.

It supports the integration of [QGIS Fire Analytics Toolbox] with [Cell2FireW simulator].

The target users are developers and researchers who want to reuse these algorithms in their own projects, as well as terminal users looking to gain efficiency by running the algorithms via CLI instead of through the QGIS GUI.

* [Installation & Quickstart](https://github.com/fire2a/fire2a-lib/blob/main/README.md)
* [API Documentation]
